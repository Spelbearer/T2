T2

This repository contains a PyQt application for converting tabular data into

KML files. Numerical grouping ranges use Jenks natural breaks with
a fallback to equal intervals when data variety is low. Zero values are
considered when calculating ranges. The interface now allows selecting
any number of groups up to twenty.
